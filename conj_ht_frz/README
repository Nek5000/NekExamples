This case is identical to the CHT case. But it runs with a frozen
velocity and the heat load is unsteady.

The heat load is sinusoidal and the parameters can be controlled
through the par file.

The temperature and scalar 1 are solved with Helmholtz and compared
/ grep tmax to get the comparison.
If you want to maximize the CVODE advantage follow instructions in the 
.par file.
