This example demonstrates how to post-process files output by avg_all
to calculate rms velocities for pipe flow.

1. The script genmesh (included) was used to generate the mesh p1.rea.
A coarse mesh has been used here for demonstration purposes. Modify
the parameters in genmesh based on the resolution requirements based
on the Re number.

2. p1.usr is used to call avg_all in userchk and outputs avgp10*, rmsp10* and
rm2p10* files. 

3. This mesh has inflow-outflow boundary conditions on the streamwise surfaces.
Consequently p1.usr has recirculation boundary condition implemented which
allows flow to develop as it becomes turbulent.

4. After running p1, use the script genpp to generate two list files.
avg.list will have the name of all the avgp10* files and rms.list will
have the names of all the rmsp10* files.

5. compile and run the case "pp". pp.usr has the routines which load data from
files listed in avg.list and rms.list to determine the u,v and w rms
velocities.
