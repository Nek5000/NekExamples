# 2D example of conjugate heat transfer.

The domain consists of two plates of finite thickness (h=0.5) 
with plane Poiseiulle flow moving between the plates from left 
to right (x=0 to 8).

The gap height is 1.0 (y=0 to 1).

The flow inlet temperature is T=0 and the plates are heated
with volumetric heat source, qvol = 1.

Insulated boundary conditions are applied on the solid
surfaces that are not interior to the computational domain,
so heat leaves only through advection at the flow outlet.
