#  To build a 3D pipe with sudden expansion, do the following:
#
#
#    1) Make certain you have built the nek tools via:
#
#        cd ~/nek5_svn/trunk/tools
#        maketools all
#
#    2) After making the tools (specifically, genmap, genbox, pretex),
#       return to this working directory and type
#
#       mkmesh
#
#    3) To run, copy ~/nek5_svn/trunk/tools/nek/makenek to this directory,
#       then type
#
#
#       makenek expansion
#       nek expansion      # run on one core
#
#       or
#
#       nekmpi expansion 4      # run on 4 cores
#
#       or
#
#       nekbmpi expansion 4     # run on 4 cores in background mode
#
#  Of course, you will need nek, nekmpi, nekbmpi in your path.
#  They reside in ~/nek5_svn/trunk/tools/scripts.
#
#  You can change the SIZE file and recompile in the usual way.
#  If you increase lx1,etc., you probably should reduce lelt and
#  use more processors.
#
#  With increased resolution you probably also need to reduce dt,
#  which can be done by editing the base cyl2d.rea file prior to
#  mesh construction or by editing the resultant "expansion.rea" file.
#
#
#  The mesh construction procedure is described in the mkmesh script
#  in this directory.
#
#  By studying this script you should be able to see how to do basic
#  mesh refinement.   Many more options open up if you actually use the
#  graphical preprocessor, prenek, to edit the base file cyl2d.rea.
#
#  See the "primer" notes on the wiki for some rudimentary introduction to
#  prenek.
