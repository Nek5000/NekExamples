IMPLEMENTATIONS OF TURBULENT INFLOW IN NEK5000

In many cases, one requires the flow coming into the domain to be fully
turbulent. In general there are two ways to address the situation: 

(1)

First by recycling the flow from a part of the domain, which is done by
mapping the flow from a cross-section to the inflow.  This to an extent is
similar to having a periodic boundary condition

  |    ---------------------|-----------------------------
  |                         |
in ===>                     |                            out
			    |
       ---------------------|-----------------------------  
                   cross-section from which
                   flow is recycled


For implementing the recycling boundary condition, we can adopt two
methodologies. 

a) The traditional method, which is turned on in the turbInflow.usr
   using the call to 

    set_inflow(nslab) 

    where nslab = number of "slabs" between the inflow and the
    cross-section from which the flow is recycled. 
    An important thing to remember about using this method is that
    the channel that is used for recycling has to be made using 
    genbox, and also the numbering of the elements of the channel
    has to start from the inflow.

    Example: In the current case the channel has 10 elements
             along the x-axis (see box file used to create the channel). 
             Thus, in order to map the velocity from the cross-section 
             at x=5, we have to use nslab = 5.

             Instead of 10 elements between x=0 to x=10, if there were
             100 equally placed elements. We would have to use 
              nslab = 50

b)  A recent implementation of the recycling boundary has been done
    using the fast interpolaotion routines  "fgslib_findpts_*", 
    and called using 

    set_inflow_fpt(dx,dy,dz,ubar)

    where dx,dy,dz is the vector between he inflow 
    cross-section and the section from which the velocity 
    is being mapped, and ubar is the mean inflow velocity.

    Example: In this case, dx=5, dy=0 and dz=0

The major advantage of the new implementaiton is that it does not require the
use of genbox to create the mesh, which opens up the possibility of using 
the recycling inflow for complex geometries. 

There is no difference in accuracy between the two methods, though the
traditional method might be slightly faster for larger problems.  

     
(2)

The second way to have a turbulent inflow is to use synthetic turblence.                           
An implementation of synthetic turbulence is currently under construciton, 
and will be added to the updates of this example in the near future.
